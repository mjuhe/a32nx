# A380X Project Files

The project directory is structured as follows:

```text
- docs            <Specific docs for the project>
- src             <src files required for the project>
- out             <contains MSFS package folder after the build>
```

The `out` folder can be deleted as it is completely recreated during the build.
This is essentially a clean build.

## A380X INOP systems

These systems are currently not operational / these features are missing and shall thus not lead to bug reports.

### ATA 20 Aircraft General / Exterior 3D Model

- THR NOISE, DCLB

### ATA 22 Flight Management System (FMS)

- Incomplete pages see fbw-a380x/src/systems/instruments/src/MFD/pages
- Separation into three synchronized FMCs and two FMSs (currently one FMC serving one FMS)
- EO modes / EO SID
- Accurate CI, OPT and REC MAX FL computation
- NADP (see THR NOISE above)
